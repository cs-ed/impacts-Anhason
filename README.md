# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

Name: Computing Impacts on Society

Description: In this course, students will discuss the societal impacts of computing technology. The course starts with the history of computers and Internet. It will focus on areas such as privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property and the environment. Current issues that will be discussed include cryptocurrency and its fraud, computer virus, AI system and ChatGPT.

Grade level: 11th and 12th graders. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

Learning Objectives:

* Analyze Societal Impacts: Students will examine the positive and negative impacts of computing technology on society related to ethical, legal and security issues
* Apply appropriate behaviors: Students will demonstrate the ability to apply appropriate online behaviors related to privacy, freedom of speech and intellectual property

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

Learning Activities:

1. Readings will be assigned on the weekly basis. The articles are selected online. Students will post their discussion on a online platform such as Slack or Discord. Students get credits by posting their thoughts and responding to one of their selected posts. 
2. Research paper due at the end of the course. One research paper will be due at the end of the course. The idea of topics will be provided throughout the discussions in the course. For example, we will discuss the security of cryptocurrency in the course. One of the topics around the cryptocurrency is the FTX collapse. By doing research, students will learn about the background and history of the FTX and learn about its impacts on society. 

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Assessments: 

1. Students' posts will be evaluated. 
2. Students' research papers will be evaluated at the end of the semester. 
3. Students will present their research papers to their peers at the end of the semester. 
4. Quizzes will be assigned from time to time (I'm not sure about how it is done exactly. If there is a textbook for this course, the quizzes could be done in the form of multiple choices)

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

Outcomes:
1. Students not only learn the positive impacts of computing technology on society but also learn the negative impacts of it. If some of students decide to pursue their careers in the computuing technology, it is something important they need to consider throughout their careers. 
2. Privacy, freedom of speech and intelletual property are important in the ethical, legal and security aspects. Students learn the importance of their behaviors when they are online. They should be able to demonstrate the ability to navigate the digital environments in a way thatâ€™s safe and responsible and to actively and respectfully engage.
3. With the booming of AI systems such as ChatGPT, the positive side of it is obvious; however, students should be encouraged to explore the negative impacts it might bring to the society.
